PLEASE READ BEFORE PROCEEDING:

To all who may read this, the reason why this repository is called Workshop_advanced_databases_2 is because the repository Workshop_advanced_databases suffered some inconveniences. 
Even though the workshop clearly said "assignment2" a txt files with point 4 to 8 and the sql file which contains the creation, filling and sequence creation of the tables and respective images giving solution to points 1 and 3 I took the liberty of adding the whole SQL including the creation of tables, procedures, functions and overall everything called Workshop2_Final.
Only those who truly spent time in the making made commits withint the text files, only those who truly worked had anything to do with them, the other one is up to you...

The members of the team ordered by their matter in the making of this workshop:
Sebastian Alarcon Ochoa, Laura Andrea Zuluaga Diaz
David Correa Arroyave
